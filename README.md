Sometimes we want to teach a work buddy to leave their computer locked, we have all got data there that should be protected, don't we? Although the result can be just funny and enough of an excuse to catch a distracted fella for a laugh.

To run the script 
```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PootisPenserHere/prankScripts/master/multiPlatform/default.sh | bash
```
Shortened url 
```sh
curl https://goo.gl/zMNr8N | bash
```
